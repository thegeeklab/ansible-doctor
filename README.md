This project is based on the idea (and at some parts on the code) of [ansible-autodoc](https://github.com/AndresBott/ansible-autodoc) by Andres Bott so credits goes to him for his work.

_ansible-doctor_ is a simple annotation like documentation generator based on Jinja2 templates. While _ansible-doctor_ comes with a default template called `readme`, it is also possible to write custom templates to customize the output or render the data to other formats like HTML or XML as well.

_ansible-doctor_ is designed to work within a CI pipeline to complete the existing testing and deployment workflow. Releases are available as Python Packages on [GitHub](https://github.com/thegeeklab/ansible-doctor/releases) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-doctor/) and as Docker Image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/thegeeklab/ansible-doctor).

The full documentation is available at [https://ansible-doctor.geekdocs.de](https://ansible-doctor.geekdocs.de/).
